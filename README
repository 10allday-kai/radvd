Installation:
=============

Run configure, e.g.

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/inet6/include" LDFLAGS="-s -L/usr/inet6/lib"  ./configure \
	--prefix=/usr/inet6

The configure script will now try to guess where your IPv6 libraries and
include files are if you don't specify them explicitly via LDFLAGS or
CPPFLAGS respectively. Currently it will search in /usr/inet6/(include|lib)
and /usr/ipv6/(include|lib). You still have to use the --prefix option
to specify the install tree though.

Be aware that --enable-eui-64 is the default, use --disable-eui-64 to
disable EUI-64 support.

See configure --help for additional command line arguments.

Run make and make install. 


Notes
=====

radvdump is a small program which dumps all received RAs in a human
readable form.

Starting with version pre0.4.1-2 I changed all usages of u_int*_t to
uint*_t. The new code will not compile on older Linux systems. If you're
desperate try defining translations for the new types in includes.h
(e.g. #define uint8_t u_int8_t).

Philip Blundell emailed me that there is a problem with struct cmsghdr with
some combinations of glibc and the kernel. So if you experience problems
with radvd it might be due to this problem. It's not fully known which
versions of glibc and the kernel are affected and there's no fix
available (10/23/97).

For bug reports, fixes and suggestions contact me at lf@elemental.net.
