radvdump
========

radvdump is a small program which dumps all received RAs in a human
readable form.

Installation:
=============

Run configure, e.g.

CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/ipv6/include" LDFLAGS="-s -L/usr/ipv6/lib"  ./configure \
	--prefix=/usr/ipv6

The configure script will now try to guess where your IPv6 libraries and
include files are if you don't specify them explicitly via LDFLAGS or
CPPFLAGS respectively. Currently it will search in /usr/inet6/(include|lib)
and /usr/ipv6/(include|lib).

Be aware that --enable-eui-64 is the default, use --disable-eui-64 to
disable EUI-64 support.

See configure --help for additional command line arguments.

Run make and make install.
