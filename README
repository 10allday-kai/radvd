Installation:
=============

Run configure, e.g.

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc --mandir=/usr/share/man

The configure script will now try to guess where your IPv6 libraries and
include files are if you don't specify them explicitly via LDFLAGS or
CPPFLAGS respectively. Currently it will search in /usr/inet6/(include|lib)
and /usr/ipv6/(include|lib). You still have to use the --prefix option
to specify the install tree though. The default prefix is /usr/local.

Be aware that --enable-eui-64 is the default, use --disable-eui-64 to
disable EUI-64 support.

See configure --help for additional command line arguments.

Run make and make install.
