read list of interfaces with SIOCGIFCONF (AF_INET6 support in the kernel would
be nice) or from /proc

follow interface state via netlink interface and send RAs only when the
interface is up

man page for radvdump

information in INTRO.html is outdated

add on option to radvdump to dump incoming RAs as a radvd config file

use getaddrinfo() instead of inet_pton in scanner.l so that DNS names
can be used
