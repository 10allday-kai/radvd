read list of interfaces with SIOCGIFCONF (AF_INET6 support in the kernel would
be nice) or from /proc

follow interface state via netlink interface and send RAs only when the
interface is up

information in INTRO.html is outdated

add on option to radvdump to dump incoming RAs as a radvd config file
(inital code is in, coded by Marko)

use getaddrinfo() instead of inet_pton in scanner.l so that DNS names
can be used

Quoting Peter Bieringer (peter@bieringer.de):

[ Peter wants that a debugging level greater than 0 doesn't stop radvd
from forking.]

support for few protocol constants defined in RFC 2461 Sec 10 is missing.

TODOs by Marko:

* double check all functions/system calls for buffer overflows/security
  vulnerabilities (I know practically nothing about buffer overflows etc,
  so I can't help here. For example: is it possible to send strange Router
  advertisement with malicious fields/code and affect to system running
  radvd which receives the adv?)
* read the man pages one more time and make sure their are understandable
  and English is correct - my written English is far from perfect
* finish radvdump --file-output interface identifier code
  (hard-coded eth0->actual receiving interface - for both BSD/Linux)


There's a problem with the signal handling and the recv function. We
probably need to add a select in front of the recv call to exit recv_rs_ra
in time.
